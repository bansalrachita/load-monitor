This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).## LibrariesIn this project, I've used react, redux and react-router JS libraries for building the Calendar app.<br>Helper libraries were used as under -- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for creating the framework template code.- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for all date related calculations.- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as code formatter- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)  for styling the components.## SetupA set of data from is placed in theproject as a file named as events.jsonThis data is also used to test the application.### Pre-requisites- node- npm- GNU make (if running using makefile)### Scripts#### 1. MakefileIn the project directory, you can run:<br>##### `make`There's a Makefile included in this project at the top of the repository. TheMakefile is very simple and has a default target to install the npm dependencies and start the server in development mode.There are additional targets as under which are self-explanatory.`make help` , `make clean`, `make install` and `make run`.#### 2. npm scriptsThe project can also be run using the package.json scripts.In the project directory, you can run:<br>##### `npm start`Runs the app in the development mode.<br>Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>You will also see any lint errors in the console if running in the development mode.The server is running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)<br>Open the server [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api) to view the data.##### `npm run build`Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>The static files under build folder can be served using server.js.#### TestingTests are written for the alerting login using the unit test libraries Mocha and chai.The test implementation can be found under './tests/project/service/monitoring.service.test.js'To run the tests execute the command below,##### `npm test-server`#### Improvements- Created push notification on alert generated.- Create Socket API to constantly push the stream of events when data is available.- Write the tests for client application.
